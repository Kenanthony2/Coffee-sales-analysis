1.Summary: Between 2023 and 2024, a coffee retail business recorded total sales of 630k from 100 customers. A Tableau dashboard was developed to uncover sales trends, identify top-performing products and regions, and evaluate the impact of discount strategies. Key findings reveal a significant role of discounting in revenue generation, consistent daily sales, notable geographical and product based patterns.

2. What does this business owner want/goals: The coffee retailer aimed to understand its sales performance better, assess customer behavior, drive future decisions around promotions, product focus and regional strategy. 

Key goals included:

Identify peak and low-performing sales periods

Analyze the impact of discounts on revenue

Determine best-selling products and regions

Discount usage

Product type (coffee beans)

Geographic location (cities)

4. Key Insights and Findings:

Total Sales: 630K across 100 customers

Discount Impact: 97 customers who used discounts generated 621K in sales, while only 3 non-discount users accounted for 9K. This suggests discounts significantly influence purchase volume and customer conversion.

Seasonality: June and March had peak monthly sales; April and October showed the lowest. This hints at mid-year seasonal purchasing behavior.

Leverage Discounts: Given their proven effectiveness, discounts should be strategically timed around low-performing months (e.g. April & October) to boost sales.

Stock Top Performers: Focus inventory and marketing on Colombian and Costa Rica beans.

Geo-targeting: Explore expansion and promotions in cities similar to Hail based on demographics and buying behavior.

Seasonal Planning: Prepare inventory and marketing campaigns to align with high-sales months.
